1. What is React?
ans: 
* Redux is a JavaScript library that helps manage the state of an application. It's often used with React, but can also be used with other view libraries. Redux's architecture includes: 
Centralization: Centralizes the application's state and logic, which can enable features like undo/redo and state persistence. 
Debuggable: Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how the application's state changed. 
Flexibility: Redux works with any UI layer and has a large ecosystem of add-ons. 
Redux is useful because it makes state management easier, especially for applications with many components that need to share data. For example, Redux takes control of the information and actions of accounts away from the components and gives it to a centralized place called a "store". Each component has access to the store, which can relay any given state to any given component. 
* Redux is simply a store to store the state of the variable in your app
